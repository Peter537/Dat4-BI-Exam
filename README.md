[] Make clustering based on questions (No PCA)
[] Use cluster results to create new column based on cluster results
[] Use new columns to classify and predict (cluster number can be used as prediction point)
[] Fetch country data (population statistics, etc...) and formulate questions which both data can be used to answer: Ex. Does BNP have an effect on salary?
[] Use new data to regress
