## Problem Statement

In the ever-changing world of IT development, new jobs are constantly being created. Navigating the sea of different titles can be challenging for students, employees, and employers alike. To assist in determining the expected salary for specific types of work, our application will search through employment data and predict the compensation an employee should expect to receive for their work.

## Implementation Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the streamlit application with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

If streamlit isn't installed, install it using `pip install streamlit`.
If the terminal doesn't recognize the command, you can use `python -m streamlit run app.py` instead.
Unfortunately, we don't have a requirements.txt file, so you'll have to install the required packages manually if encounter any errors.
