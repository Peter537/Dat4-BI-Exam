Business Model: Global Career Advisors (m√•ske skift senere)

Mission:
To empower students and professionals in making informed decisions about their career paths by providing personalized advice on optimal workplaces around the world.

Marketing Stragety:
We provide a global workspace intelligence, finding the most appropriate build for an effective job with an effective income.
We will in this data figure out what type of workmode is better (eg. remote, on-site og hybrid) as well as what sort of jobs have done best over the years.

Tasks:

[] Create different questions for what to research: Ex. as education institute I want to know what jobs are available in my country. Ex. as employee I want to know how much I should earn
[] Make clustering based on questions (No PCA)
[] Use cluster results to create new column based on cluster results
[] Use new columns to classify and predict (cluster number can be used as prediction point)
[] Fetch country data (population statistics, etc...) and formulate questions which both data can be used to answer: Ex. Does BNP have an effect on salary?
[] Use new data to regress
